<!-- During my academic journey, I actively engaged in AI-related research projects, where I gained hands-on experience in developing and implementing machine learning models. My passion for AI led myself to explore diverse domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics.

I have solid foundation in programming languages such as Python that enables me to effectively build and deploy AI models also well-versed in popular AI frameworks and libraries, including PyTorch, and possesses strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

As a fresh graduate, I've brings a fresh perspective and an eagerness to contribute to real-world AI projects. I'm a quick learner and keeps up with the latest advancements in AI by actively participating in online communities especially in Kaggle.
